(101 Townsend St., San Francisco, CA 94107, USA) to make our website faster and safer. Cloudflare uses cookies and processes user data. Cloudflare, Inc. is an American company that provides a content delivery network and various security services. These services are located between the user and our hosting provider and act as a reverse proxy for websites. What exactly all this means, we try to explain in more detail below. </p> <h5> What is Cloudflare? </h5> <p> A content delivery network (CDN), as provided by Cloudflare, is nothing else as a network of servers connected over the Internet. Cloudflare has distributed such servers all over the world to bring websites to your screen faster. Simply put, Cloudflare makes copies of our website and places them on their own servers. When you visit our website now, a load balancing system ensures that most of our website is delivered by the server that can display our website to you the fastest. A CDN significantly shortens the data transfer route to your browser. Thus, the content of our website is delivered to you by Cloudflare not only from our hosting server, but from servers from all over the world. The use of Cloudflare is particularly helpful for users from abroad, since here the page can be delivered from a server nearby. In addition to the fast delivery of websites, Cloudflare also offers various security services, such as DDoS protection or the web application firewall. </p> <h5> What data is stored by Cloudflare? </h5> <p> Cloudflare generally only conducts forward the data that is controlled by the website operator. The content is not determined by Cloudflare, but always by the website operator himself. In addition, Cloudflare may collect certain information about the use of our website and process data that is sent by us or for which Cloudflare has received instructions. In most cases, Cloudflare receives data such as contact information, IP addresses, security fingerprints, DNS log data and performance data for websites that are derived from browser activity. For example, log data helps Cloudflare identify new threats. In this way, Cloudflare can guarantee a high level of security protection for our website. Cloudflare processes this data as part of the services in compliance with the applicable laws. This of course also includes the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). </p> <br> <p> For security reasons, Cloudflare also uses a cookie. The cookie (__cfduid) is used to identify individual users behind a shared IP address and to apply security settings for each individual user. This cookie becomes very useful, for example, if you use our website from a location with a number of infected computers. However, if your computer is trustworthy, we can recognize this by means of the cookie. In this way, you can surf our website unhindered despite infected PCs in the vicinity. It is also important to know that this cookie does not save any personal data. This cookie is essential for the Cloudflare security functions and cannot be deactivated. </p> <h5> Cookies from Cloudflare </h5> <p> __cfduid </p><p> Expiry time: 1 year </p> <p> Use: Security settings for each individual visitor </p> <p> Example value: 9f1a75f28315de27aadb65d1609517766 </p> <p> Cloudflare also works with third-party providers. They may only process personal data under the instruction of Cloudflare and in accordance with the data protection guidelines and other confidentiality and security measures. Cloudflare does not pass on any personal data without our explicit consent. </p> <h5> How long and where is the data stored? </h5> <p> Cloudflare stores your information mainly in the USA and in the European Economic Area. Cloudflare can transmit and access the information described above from all over the world. In general, Cloudflare stores user-level data for Free, Pro and Business versions of domains for less than 24 hours. For enterprise domains that have activated Cloudflare Logs (formerly Enterprise LogShare or ELS), the data can be stored for up to 7 days. However, if IP addresses trigger security warnings on Cloudflare, there may be exceptions to the storage duration listed above. </p> <h5> How can I delete my data or prevent data storage? </h5> <p> Cloudflare preserves data Logs are only kept for as long as necessary and this data is also deleted within 24 hours in most cases. Cloudflare also does not store any personal data, such as your IP address. However, there is information that Cloudflare saves indefinitely as part of its permanent logs in order to improve the overall performance of Cloudflare Resolver and to identify any security risks. You can find out exactly which permanent logs are saved at https://www.cloudflare.com/application/privacypolicy/. All data that Cloudflare collects (temporarily or permanently) is cleaned of all personal data. All permanent logs are also anonymized by Cloudflare. </p> <p> Cloudflare states in their privacy policy that they are not responsible for the content they receive. For example, if you ask Cloudflare whether you can update or delete your content, Cloudflare always refers to us as the website operator. You can also completely prevent the entire collection and processing of your data by Cloudflare by deactivating the execution of script code in your browser or by integrating a script blocker into your browser. </p><p> Cloudflare is an active participant in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework which regulates the correct and secure transfer of personal data.
